# Services

Configurations for services and containers.

## Setup

- Clone the main repository and submodules (make sure your SSH-key has access to
  private repos too):

```
git clone -j8 --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules git@github.com:Clubs-Council-IIITH/services.git
cd services
```

## Testing

- To test in local machine run the `run.sh` script which runs the micro-services
  in foreground.
